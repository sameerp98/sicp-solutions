# Ex 1.15

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

a) how many times is p called for `(sine 12.15)`

```scheme
(sine 12.15)
(p (sine (/ 12.15 3)))
(p (sine (4.5)))
(p (p (sine (/ 4.5 3))))
(p (p (sine (1.5))))
(p (p (p (sine (/ 1.5 3)))))
(p (p (p (sine (0.5)))))
(p (p (p (p (sine (/ 0.5 3))))))
(p (p (p (p (sine (0.16666))))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine (/ 0.16666 3)))))))
(p (p (p (p (p (sine (0.05)))))))
(p (p (p (p (p (0.05))))))
```

As we can see p is called 5 times to get to the final value of `sine(12.15)`. 

b) Order of growth and number of steps ? 

At every step we are diving the `angle` by 3. That means we are essentially taking out one power of 3 from the input `angle`. So we were to take log (base 3) of the `angle` we can get the overall complexity. One small thing to note here that we don't want angle to become 0 instead we stop when it becomes 0.1 so we first take out 0.1 from `angle` and then take log base 3. Hence the complexity can be represented as : `o(log base 3 (angle/(0.1)))`.
